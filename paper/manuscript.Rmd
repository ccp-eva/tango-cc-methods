# Introduction
- increased interest in cc research but not many new methods that enable or ease cross cultural research
- hard to capture ind diff, even harder in cc settings
- goal: comparable data across cultural settings
- approach 1: standardized procedure, as similar as possible. taken here
- approach 2: see in each cultural setting how to translate the psychological construct into experiment
- prein2023tango: works for ind diff. reliable. 
- supplements prein2023variation: differences between animal & human faces

# Methods
- testing setups: rural & urban
- no prior touchscreen experience needed
- how does website work: which variables you can select
- output from website
- shiny app?!
- psychometric properties of tango germany
- describe cc sample

# Results
- splithalf per cultural setting
- effect of age distribution, different for each cultural setting
- in plot: weigh sample size: x: splithalf, y: culture, size geom count: sample size
- visualize ind diff
- plot training trials argument for children understand to touch balloon
- response time?
- droup outs across cultures

# Discussion
- flexibility for researchers
- adjust to each cultural setting: faces, languages, background scene
- easy to add new layers to svg to adjust even further
- minimal language demands
- worked across 16(?) different communities already

# Limitations
- measure same construct across communities?
- technology effects

# Conclusion
